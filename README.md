## ‚òùÔ∏è **Pitch**

Ensuring that all your plants are consistently watered is actually pretty difficult. Water My Plants is an app that helps to solve those problems. 

With an easy to use interface for creating a plant watering schedule tailored to each individual plant, **Water My Plants** will remind users when it's time to feed that foliage and quench your plants' thirst.

## ‚úÖ  **MVP**

1. `user` can sign-up / create an account by providing a unique `username`, a valid mobile `phoneNumber` and a `password`. 
2. `user` can login to an authenticated session using the credentials provided at account creation / signup.
3. Authenticated `user` can Create, Update and Delete a `plant` object. At a minimum, each `plant` must have the following properties: 
    - `id`: Integer
    - `nickname`: String
    - `species` : String
    - `h2oFrequency`: Type determined by implementation
    - `image`: (optional)
4. Authenticated `user` can view a list of created `plants`.  A `plant` can be deleted or selected to present `user` with a detail view where `user` can then update any property of the selected `plant`. 
5. Authenticated `user` can update their `phoneNumber` and `password`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Stretch**

1. Authenticated `user` can set up push notifications to be triggered when an `h2oFrequency` of any `plant` arrives / has elapsed. 

2. Implement a feature that allows an authenticated `user` to see an appropriate suggested `h2oFrequency` based on `species` using the API of your choice. 

3. Authenticated `user` can upload `image`s of a `plant`. If no user `image` is provided, a placeholder `image` of a plant of the same `species` populates the view.

### POST

Requires JSON {
    h2oInterval,
    h2oAmount
}

plantID and ownerID are bigint assigned by back-end.

speciesID is a string that does NOT currently link to the species table

nickname and lastWatered are optional strings

image is a placeholder string, would be replaced by blob to actually hold image

### PUT/:plantID

Full JSON not required

plantID must match a plant owned by userID in auth token

### DELETE/:plantID

userID in auth token must match ownerID of plant

## /api/species

Warning: currently does not check ownerID; use PUT and DELETE with caution

Disclaimer: Was unwired from plants to enable direct string entry.  This is bad programming, and would not happen in a real project.

### GET
Returns a list of all plant species

### POST

Requires JSON {
    speciesName,
    h2oInterval,
    h2oAmount
}

speciesID assigned by back end

### PUT/:speciesID

Warning: currently changes species without checking for plants not owned by userID in auth token

### DELETE/:speciesID

Warning: currently removes without checking for plants not owned by userID in auth token
